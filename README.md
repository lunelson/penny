# penny: a no-build zero-config dev server

```sh
npm install -g @lunelson/penny
```

A static-server with benefits:

* Pug.js, Node-Sass and Rollup.js as view-engines
* Advanced helper functions in templates and stylesheets
* Custom data injection in templates and stylesheets
* File-watching and synched live-reloading in development
* Minification, compression and caching in production
